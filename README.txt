I thought about dropping to the next line when a process ended, but that 
would mean for every process. Thus, if you run 3 processes at once, the
console will drop 3 times, a line for every finished process.

You can still enter commands will programs are running. Commands do not
internally co-mingle with the output, only on the screen. You just have
to remember what you've typed.

Cursor's still a little buggy.
